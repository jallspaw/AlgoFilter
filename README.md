DevOps Reality Field
=============

Inspired by both [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt "Cloud To Butt") and [truthful-human-error](https://github.com/jonlives/truthful-human-error "Truthful Human Error"), this chrome extension replaces occurrences of 'devops' with 'cooperation, collaboration, and coordination.'

Direct download of the [extension](https://github.com/jallspaw/DevOpsRealityField/blob/master/DevOpsRealityField.crx?raw=true)

Installation
============

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag DevOpsRealityField.crx into the page that appears.
